description: Well known for her gentle folk wisdom, the elderly fictional Aunt Jane
  vividly describes a picturesque and almost vanished way of life in the rural South
  of the last century. Her words recall lavish Sunday dinners, courtships, quilting
  bees, church meetings, and county fair competitions. Yet Aunt Jane of Kentucky is
  more than a collection of reminiscences about the region of Western Kentucky where
  Eliza Caroline Obenchain (who published under the name Eliza Calvert Hall) was born
  and raised. A dedicated suffragist, Obenchain worked to win rights for women in
  the areas of property ownership and divorce. Now modern readers can become acquainted
  with the strong women of these tales.
